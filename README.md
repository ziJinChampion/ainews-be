## Description

<h3>Hello guys, this project is a personal blog for me to share new Ai information. I will try to update it every week. If you have any questions, please contact me. Thank you.</h3>

<br>

## Next Step

After I finish the backend, I will start to build the frontend. I will use React to build the frontend. I will try to finish it as soon as possible. Thank you. And I will integrate some Ai tools into this project, such as chatbot and images generation. 

## Quick Start

If you want to run this project in your local machine, you need to run this command in your terminal.

```bash
go mod download
```

```bash
go run main.go
```

And before you run this project, you need to create a pg database in your local machine. I will add docekr-compose file later. Thank you.
